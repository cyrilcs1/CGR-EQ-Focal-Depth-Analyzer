This program is similar to the program 'cgrforeqdepthanalysis'. 
Only one file should be given as input. It should be specified in 'filename'
the bindividsion for that file should be given in binbound

The program creates a synthectic sequence of same length as the eq data specified in 'filename' with similar frequency distribution.


All the outputs are same as for the prgram 'cgrfrdepthanalysis', but the outputs corresponding to filename1 are the ones given by the synthetic sequence.
